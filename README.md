# Msc_project

This is a C++ package developed for simulating different polymer-like
structures. The code is capable of constructing, modeling, and
simulating the dynamics of flexible, semi-flexible, and rigid
polymers using Brownian dynamics (BD) or Langevin dynamics (LD) in
2D. The code uses separated shifted Lennard-Jones (SSLJ) potential
to model the non-bonded interactions between different particles
used to construct the polymer system. This potential allows
different particles in the simulation to overlap and therefore takes
advantage of a quasi 2D dynamical model. The bonded interactions
within each polymer is modeled, using different bonded potential,
including: bond, angle, and length and area constraints.
The trajectories are then generated by calculating the gradient of
each potential (forces) and velocity-verle algorithm to reposition
the particles. 
In order to make the process more computationally efficient, the code
was profiled and the most expensive part,
the non-bonded force calculation, was parallelized on CPU, using
openMP.

This code was previously tested on a system containing a
semi-flexible ring-shape polymer and multiple rigid polymers,
modeling the cell membrane and Cytoskeleton filaments, respectively.
The model then was used to study the cell motility on a substrate
(a published work which can be found [here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sm/c7sm00439g/unauth#!divAbstract)).
